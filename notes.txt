# Notes for the graphQL
*/

1. create project => nest new project_name
2. create new module => nest g module module_name
3. you do not need APIs in the graphQL so we need to use resolver here
4. create new resolver => nest g resolver resolver_name
5. you can create entity in which graphQL can create schema itself
6. if you want to go code first then pass  autoSchemaFile: join(process.cwd(), 'src/schema.gql') in the main module 
   under the forRoot option. also we can pass driver as ApolloDriver and playground to be true
